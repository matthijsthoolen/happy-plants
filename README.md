## 🌱 About

[**HappyPlants**](https://happyplants.garden) is all about collecting, organising, and adding all kinds of information of your little friends. _How much water does it need? During which seasons does it grow? When is it dormant? Does it require lots of sun?_ Basically, creating your own plant database in a visual way. You can either save HappyPlants to your homescreens on mobile devices (recommended) or add it to your bookmarks on desktop. This is a **mobile-first web application**.

## 🔜 Version 2

HappyPlants is currently being rewritten for a new major release with more features and better application architecture. The progress can be found in [**`packages/app-next`**](packages/app-next).
